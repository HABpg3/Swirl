<p> The outfield has  three positions. Right and left field and center field. These positions cover the whole outfield. So they are responsible for a lot of field.
<br>
<h3> Left Field</h3>
<p> Left field is responsible for most of the balls hit to the outfield, because since most batters are right handed, most balls are hit to left field. Left field has to hit the cutoff man at shortstop when they get the ball. But if it is a high fly ball, they try to catch the ball before it hits the ground to get the automatic out. </p>
<br>
<h3> Right field</h3> Right has the job to play the outfield on the right side of the field. Right field hits the cutoff man when they get the ball. If the ball it catchable in the air, that is what to do to get the automatic out on the runner.</p>
<br>
<h3> Center Fielder</h3>
<p> The center fielder has the job running the outfield. The center fielder is set up almost straight out from home plate in the outfield. The center fielder runs the outfield, communicating between the outfielders.
