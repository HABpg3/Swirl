<p> The Infield has six positions. Those positions are, first base, second base, shortstop, third base, pitcher, and catcher. Here will cover the basics of each of those positions.</p>
<br>
<h3> First Baseman</h3>
<p> First base is the base on the right foul line. That is the base the runner will first be running to, to get the runner out you wiil want to have your first baseman tag the base with the baseball in their glove before the runner makes it to the base</p>
<br>
<h3>Second Baseman</h3> 
<p> The second baseman is the one who mainly covers second base. They play on the left side of the base facing home plate. They are also the cut-off man if the ball is hit into right field. </p>
<br>
<h3> Shortstop</h3>
<p>Shortstop plays to the right side of second base facing home plate. Shortstop's job is to play second base when the second baseman is acting as cutoff man. When the ball is hit out to left field shortstop is the cutoff man.</p>
<br>
<h3>Third Baseman</h3>
<p> The third baseman plays at third base. Their job is to hold runners on third and make sure they do not get home. The third baseman has the furthest infield throw to first base. </p>
<br>
<h3> Pitcher </h3>
<p> The pitcher plays at the mound in the middle of the infield. The pitcher is the one who pitches the ball to the batter. Also the pitcher is the one responsible for throwing the different kinds of pitches trying to strike the batter out.</p>
<br>
<h3> Catcher </h3>
<p> Thhe catcher has the job of catching and throwing back the pitches to the pitcher. The catcher also has the job of throwing out any runner trying to steal a base. A catcher also tags players out at home to make sure they do not score a run.
